*Sometimes the chance of something happening is not as big as it seems.*

The 95% Threshold is an action game. It's played with the mouse, using the keyboard for the menus.

Originally created by @5ro4 (Vanesa Mayonesa) for the Guinux Jam 2019, this game has been updated using the latest available version of Unity 6 with some adjustments. I uploaded it to GitHub to provide better visibility and for educational purposes.
